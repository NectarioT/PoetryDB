participant User
participant server
participant PoetryDB
participant DiscordBot

User ->server: Browser requests "/", the root of our site
server -> User: Sends 200 okay and returns index.html form
User->server: User fills our the form and gives the author name \nthat wants to be loaded into the discord bot.\nIf the form is empty it assumes that the user wants a random poem


server ->PoetryDB: gets the information from the poetryDB. It recieves 200
PoetryDB->DiscordBot: stores the information that the discord bot will access
PoetryDB->server:signals that the information stream has finished by signaling 200OK\nthe user can resubmit a new random poem to the bot if they wish

note over DiscordBot: at this point if the user wants\nto access the streamed data\nthe user needs the discord bot in their server\n\nTo do this the user needs to authenticate their account to the \nwebsite and give access to the bot to join said server.\nDiscord makes authentication very easy
